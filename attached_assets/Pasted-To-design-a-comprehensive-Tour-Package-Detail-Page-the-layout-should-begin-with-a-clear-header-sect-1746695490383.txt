To design a comprehensive Tour Package Detail Page, the layout should begin with a clear header section that includes the package name (e.g., “7-Day Europe Highlights Tour”), destinations covered, duration (e.g., 7 Days / 6 Nights), user ratings, review count, and a visible price starting per person. Prominent “Book Now” and “Enquire” buttons, along with a badge indicating whether flights are included, help with quick decision-making. A hero image carousel should showcase 5–10 high-quality images of landmarks, accommodations, meals, and group activities, with an optional promotional video for added engagement.

Following this, a quick highlights bar should present essential tour data: cities covered, travel mode (flight/train/bus), tour type (group/customizable/private), visa assistance, and a “customizable” badge if applicable. The price and traveler breakdown section must display pricing for adults, children (with/without bed), infants, and seniors, and include offers such as early bird discounts or EMI options. A detailed “What’s Included” section should clearly list all included services—such as hotel accommodations, meals, sightseeing, transfers, flights, tickets, guides, and insurance—and contrast them with exclusions like personal expenses, optional excursions, visa charges, and tips.

An expandable day-wise itinerary gives users an overview of daily activities, including titles, meal inclusions, hotel details, and optional paid add-ons. A separate hotel and flight info section should provide names, star ratings, images, and flight schedules. If flights are not included, users should be able to add them optionally. User trust is built through a reviews and ratings section with breakdowns by categories like travel, food, and hotel, plus real photos from previous travelers. A departure date selector and availability calendar should also show seasonal price variations.

The booking form must allow users to select traveler count, trip dates, add-ons, and apply promo codes, followed by a price summary and final booking button. Include an FAQ section addressing customization, refunds, insurance, and minimum traveler requirements. To encourage exploration, add a carousel of related packages that users also viewed or booked. The overall design and feel should be visually inspiring and mobile-friendly, with trust-enhancing icons (🛏️, ✈️, 🍽️, 🚌), color-coded pricing badges (e.g., “Best Seller”), and smooth responsiveness across devices.
